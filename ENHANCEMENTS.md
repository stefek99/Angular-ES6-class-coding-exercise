* ability to use the app without the login
* settings (miles / kilometers)
* input type datetime-local - different on different platforms

* popup when deleting? That would lead to more decisions - use Ionic? Angular Bootstrap? Yet another library... (leaving it inline for now)
* disallow editing multiple rows at the same time?
* force finishing operation before adding new entry?
* timout operation after 20s of in-action?


ADMIN INTERFACE... HMMM...

(tempted to make it a separate app so the code is not visible to the users)

On the other hand Firebase rules are making it secure!

KNOWN BUGS:
* Editing data that is out of... Check edit mode... || editmode!!! (easy, one line fix)
